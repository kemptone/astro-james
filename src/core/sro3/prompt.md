We are creating a simple tide game. There will be a total of 4 tides in a day. 
6am will be alpha high tide of 6ft
12pm will be alpha low tide of 3ft
6pm will be maximum omega high tide of 10.5ft
midnight will be the lowest tide of -3.19ft

The interface will be an input element where you set the time, and a box will display the tide as a percentage of the box. with the maximum size of the box being 11ft, and the minimum being -4ft. So, some math is involved here to set these levels.
