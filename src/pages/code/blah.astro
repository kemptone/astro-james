Joe started walking and noticed he lost his keys. so mom came to help hi<a
  href="">m</a
>. after he helped him, he was all better. since he made something fun, he drew
a picture for mom. the image was <input
  type="image"
  src="/lights/IMG_3479.png"
  alt=""
  width="400"
/>
mom loved it. he also rememberd since when he would ever do that, he would of used
<input type="image" src="/tail/IMG_3479.png" alt="" /> so he would of been serious
about drills. no wa<a href="">y</a>!!!!! i would never do that. how on freaking
earth??????????!!!!!!!!! Joe shouted and yelled. Mila would never worry. since
she chose a stupid card he said. he would of flooded the house. "i don't give a
