    this boy went around the backyard to find something nice. so, the temprature
    outside was about 30˚F outside. it was very cold, so he had to wear a scarf,
    jacket<a href="">,</a> and gloves. then he felt warmer like 60˚, so after he
    was cold, he wanted to be cold, so he dressed up naked and oh boy he was extremely
    cold. he said: "brrr" so he went and didn't get it. so, he went by to <u
      >find out what it i</u
    >s. so he found out what it is. after that he noticed. oh that is the <b
      >big</b
    > deal for coding so he went with a friendsh<a href="">i</a>p around the
    city, so, he learned french. after that, there was a backyard in front of
    him. oh so <i>is</i> it moonshadow? no, it is 6 7 dolphin fogyard. so i went
    around and saw dolphin fogyard with 6 7. after he met 6 7. they found number
