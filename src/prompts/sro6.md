sro6 is something to do with valves. so, if you type numbers
the first number is for the sprinklers. the second number is for the entire house
so that means if it's 0 0, both would be all the way on
then 100 100 would be all the way off
and if there is a third number, it would do the backyard
so, it can be 0 0 0 for a house, and 100 100 100 if the house water is off
to make it work, it will send a signal from the iPad to the valves that control water pressure
and it is also good to do
it sends the signal when you press submit

it will only work if you are in the backyard of that house or inside that house. it won't work if you're in the frontyard.

Dad's notes:
This will use some kind graphics library to show different faucets around the house, and in the back yard. clicking the faucet turns on the water, and water comes out. Please make it look like water, blue, with froth maybe, and it pours on the ground. There would be a sprinkler button that would turn on the sprinklers for the grass. And another one for the trees. If the water value is off, say, 100 0 0.
