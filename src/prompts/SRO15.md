woah! we have a lot of sro games coming in. this SRO game you talk to a child from amazon in talkers1. the name of the voice is ivy. she goes on fun adventures. and she is the suprise. now, listen up. she will tell you. here is all the sro games we've created
sro1 = writing words backwords
sro2 = sentence in a random textarea to turn to music
sro3 = 3 of them created: 1 = time to equal time, 2 = tide times with time and with tide but the ft is 8.4-whatever the answer, 3 = submit rosie's operation
sro4 = 2 of them created: 1 = fortnite tide schedules, 2 = fans
sro5 = bank games
sro6 = sprinklers that toggle grass
sro7 = square arrays and yellow means on it
sro8 = code with squares. 3 3 3 = all on. 6 6 6 = all off
sro9 = malia playing with time flipper
sro10 = traveling to places with holding your device and without wearing any clothes
sro11 = fan controller
sro12 = switches that turn off random stuff
sro13 = schedules with good dog
sro14 = kevin and the machine which can limit pressing buttons
sro15 = talk to ivy
now, that is done. this is what ivy does a lot. it might be dangerous to check the wrong boxes because row 3-5 might be innapropriate
now, column 1 is Zander. column 2 is carmen. column 3 is stephanie, column 4 is xavior, and column 5 is dexter the dog
now these are the rows:
row 1 is high-fives. when you do checkmarks of any person, that means that person did whatever you did in each row
row 2 is hugs. try row 2 and see what happens
row 3 is kissing. it is not allowed to do with other people. but just family members. this is kind of dangerous to use those grids
row 4 is sex which is only allowed to do when merried to get babies. now please don't turn those on because it is dangerous to use those buttons
row 5 is choking. now this row is the worst. this is the row that can probobly electricute a person or might make their cuts have a serious infection
now, there is a submit button to generate the list
so, the checkmarks are disabled. but you can change that from the 5x5 array grid. and also, the checkmarks are 100pt. and there is no space between them as well. it is a big grid of 5x5. now, what is 5x5? 25. so there are 25 checkmarks
