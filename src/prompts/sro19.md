this is an app of sro19. so, the prompt is about tides. oh it is <i>fun<i>
fun level = super fun
so. i am sorry that it is complicated to do this, but you can ask the fishing man. but remember, this age rating is 17+ which means it is not for kids because there is violence in this content. so, if this became an app, the age rating would say 17+
and if you buy it and ask permission, there will be a text. it would say: sro19 has restricted material. and the description is: press okay to confirm you are 17 or older
but anyways, here is what it does
so, you can change the tide. now, create your own tides!!!!!
so, there is a submit button that can generate the tide to tell everyone what the fortnite tide is. that way, gamers can play fortnite and fish. now, here is everything
this is weird. well, the tide can show it on the blue and on the white. well, here
0% means the entire screen is full of blue, and 100% means that it is empty. so, it is the % of how low it is, so, try increasing the number and the tide will go down. and then if you decrease it the tide goes up
next, there is the number of feet. so it is a trick! so, we got math. if you would of tried to type 6.90 on the input number, it would change to 1.50 because here it is:
8.40 - the input number you say = the answer written on the tide
there is also an input time when high or low is. so, 6:00AM is high tide. 12:00PM is low tide. 6:00PM is very high tide, and 12:00AM is very low tide. now only tide points only happen every 6 hours. so if i would of typed 12:01PM, it would say: very high tide in 5 59h. if it was 12:00PM, it would be: low tide in < 1 min which stands for less then a miniute. so, try this app!
