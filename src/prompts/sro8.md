sro8 is a controller for squares
here's how it goes
yellow square = on
square that is the color of the backround = off. the stroke color is black and the backround color is this RGB: 128 128 128
they are 9 squares that can equal. there is not 3 squares and a space. it is 9 squares that have the same distance
first number is for the squares 1-3
second number is for the squares 4-6
third number is for the squares 7-9
the numbers only go to 8
if they're all set to 1. that means only square 1, 4, and 7 are on
if they are all set to 2. that means only square 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 are on
if they are all set to 3. that means all squares are on
if they are all set to 4. that means square 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9 are on
if they are all set to 5. that means square 3, 6, and 9 are on
if they are all set to 6. that means all the squares are off
if they are all set to 7. that means square 2, 5, and 8 are on
if they are all set to 8. that means square 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9 are on
if the numbers are different. the squares will not have a pattern
here is how it goes

1. only 1 is on
2. only 1 and 2 are on
3. all are on
4. only 2 and 3 are on
5. only 3 is on
6. none are on
7. just 2 is on
8. only 1 and 3 are on
   there is also a submit button when you press submit. they don't change right after punching in the numbers. they change when you hit the submit button
