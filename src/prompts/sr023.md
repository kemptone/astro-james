wow! we are REALLY making it up and up and we are at the last sro. so, we have sro's according to this section that sro4 is a fan game, so i knows it. so there is a huge iframe in the link:
https//www.boodeboo.com/sro4
so in our game, we have ages, and you have your input to set the number of the year
so, you press reset, you can do it again. so our game is if you write any age for your name. you can write the name of the character, and then you pick your number that person was born. and then, you can pick any number and then the numbers will change

the number on your input - this other input = who was born and who made it
now, listen carefully. this is important, and these control the whole game. so if you turn off this checkbox, the entire game goes black like 0 0 0, and the only thing there was was a checkbox, and there will not be anything in this game, accept a toggle checkbox which shuts the game down. there is a sign that says: please leave checkbox checked
