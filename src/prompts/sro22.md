SRO games used to be insites, but this is another prompt in sro22! and then we also have invention for sro6. so i have an iframe which is very big! width is 100% and height is 100vh. and the iframe is in this link:
http//www.boodeboo.com/sro6. and what else is there is here: we have this date thing. you will choose what date you want. and then there is 365 x (whatever year) boxes. so many!!! and the top one is what you choose. and while you go down and down, you would see like how many years ago it was from the day you choose. for example:
let's say i would want to choose march 28, 2025. scroll down from all the way up in the year to march 28, 2025. it would turn into 0 years ago to 1 year ago. and will go on and on like that until you reach 1. so, a lot of dates and a lot of scrolling

now, if you scroll down all the way, that is where the fun begins. there will be a text to speech with a voice in ana from http://www.boodeboo.com/talkers2 and you can text her whatever you want! dooo it!!!

now, below that is something else. an input that has (number) (space) (number) and so on. so, there are 3 switches
1 means just 1 and 2 are on the UP position with 3 DOWN
2 means they are all on the UP position
3 means 1 and 3 are on the UP
4 means 1 is UP
5 means just 2 is UP
6 means 2 and 3 UP
7 means just 3 UP (good combination)
8 means none UP, all DOWN
now, the input will REALLY do something. like try typing 1 2 3 4. first, 1 and 2 are on, then 1 2 and 3, then 1 and 3, and finally, just 1. try that input, IT IS FUN!!!!!!!!!!
