this is sro5, here is evrything it was and it remembers being before:

1. this was a game where you use a filter in a video to go backwords

2. this is a game where you buy money. your name starts with m in this

3. this is a game where you can write words and put them in the week you like

4. after this update, the next update will be about changing the name of the game. but we are on version 3 today

in this game, it will be about writing words down
so, this man named cornot will help with the game. so in the input where you type numbers, it goes up to 1234567
if it has a 1, **\_** will happen on monday
2, tuesday
3, wednesday
4, thursday
5, friday
6, saturday
7, sunday

if you don't know and you are confused, look at the list of the 7 days above. here is how the list works:

press submit if you are done with the days of the week. so cornot will type 135, and in the input where you type in what it is, he typed in, law workers
this means they did law workers on mondays, wednesdays, and fridays. then cornot did box carrying. in the number input, it is 1 only. he would do that only ob monday
there is also another thing below and the name has have all these letters in it to enable the thing
a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l

this is where you type a number and will be subtracting

150 - whatever your number is on the input = the answer in big helvectica numbers which is 100pt!!!
and it hides the input number so that nobody knows how the person does it. it is a magic trick
