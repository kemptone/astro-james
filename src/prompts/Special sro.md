hi! have you ever heard of something? you can choose what is on the right and on the left
so, type what this thing is, and then will show it. your options are right or left. if you choose left it would be sorted in right. if you choose right it will be sorted in left. so, here is it
left:

---

---

---

right:

---

---

---

you can keep adding things to it until you press the 0 button. that will be it:
how this one works:

1. tell us what thing it is by input
2. then tell us where it goes. if right chosen then it is in left. if left chosen then on right
3. if you press the 0 button, you can see the list

now this is kinda fun! you will get to unlock new options by keep pressing submit. so, you can create options by pressing add options. you can name the options and you can make as many as you want. so, what if on the input i typed in 2. if i press submit 2 times it will unlock that opton. so the number of options will tell you how many inputs for how many times to press submit. if you press submit less then the number of times the input says, then it would be disabled. so have 100% fun on this! 100% FUN!!!!!
there is also a paintbrush at the bottom of the game. it changes the color with rgb's. so if i would of selected the rgb for black, and hit submit, it would change to the color you put in
