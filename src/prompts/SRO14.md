this game is sro14. in this game, you talk to grok who speaks out loud in a voice that is named kevin. it is kevin from talkers1 in one of the astro.james games
but when you talk to him about something that is not about this app, he says this:
that is intresting. i am a kid, and i want to be helpful. you said""so can you tell me more about this?
now, there is a machine at the bottom of the prompt. there are 5 buttons that say each number in order. 1, 2, 3, etc
and there are 5 inputs as well. each input is a number that tells you how many ti es you press one of the buttons without triggering something, that means, no script tags and no document.queryselectors
if the input says 0, the button is disabled. so, try it and see wjat happens
PS: the inputs have 1 column and 5 rows
