So my kid wants a fun game, where you put in the time, using military time, and it gives you a conversion. Only the trick is, that the new time will be the opposite. Instead of 59, it would 1, and instead of 23 it would 37

Make it kind of colorful and fun. And, if it could make a sound as it converts, that would be awesome.
