in this game, you can do what day you would like to say. as a 365 day year, it will be how many days until december 25. so, there is a leapyear on one of them, but, use one of the numbers as febuary 29, but, you can add characters that day. so, the person can choose how many feet tall the person is
10 feet would mean that the character would touch the top of the map. you can choose their hair. how does it look? you have hundreds of options!
what are the clothes they wear? choose pants, or shirts. but, there is a prettiness scale. it is how pretty the person looks. 0 is neat and handsom! 50 is just a person. 100 is beautiful! 150 is so pretty! 200 is too pretty
now, it is a good idea to leave the checkbox checked so we know who this is?
when checked, you can name the person by input
if unchecked, the input is not there, and may cause the game to be confused
let's break down the year thing
365 = december 26
0 = december 25
1 = december 24
you can choose a different number!
the prettier or more handsom the person is, the different hairstyes and clothes or even eyes
