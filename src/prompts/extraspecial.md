hi! this is the best game ever! create your own map, name your cities. and even do the weather there
so this will have a lot of inputs:
1 does the name of this city or town
2 sets the temperature of this place
3 sets the air quality, 1-500
4 sets the size of the letters in this city
5 places where the city is on the map. it stays white until you press the biggest button EVER!!!!! it is the M button and it will generate that map until colors. on the top, there is options, temperature. air quality. but it will not say it by pointing on each city
for temperature, the slider goes all the way down to -100 because -100 is black: 0 0 0
-40 is dark blue: 0 0 255
0 is blue: 0 128 255
30 is aqua: 0 255 255
60 is green: 0 255 0
70 is yellow: 255 255 0
80 is orange: 255 128 0
100 is red: 255 0 0
130 is dark red: 100 0 0
160 is black: 0 0 0, and this is the maximum for the slider
note:
if it is between those points, -100, -40... it would be a different color. so if you press submit first, THEN, adjust the slider. the colors would not be sharp difference
now, mila is addicted to this:

there is this temperature list, like when each place has a bar. if the bar hits the the far far left, that is the least. and the far far right is the most. try doing this on ipads, and try building this
for air quality:
0-30 is green. good air
31-50 is less green, a little yellow
51-75 is getting yellow
75 is yellow
76-100 is getting more orange
101-174 is getting red
175-175 is red
176-250 is getting purple
251-350 is getting maroon
351-500 is the exact same color

and the same, if if you adjust the slider up to 175-350 or anything. it will turn that color
