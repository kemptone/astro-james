how it works:
if there are 2 ac's in 1 room, then 17 1 would control which AC is on or off on the AC part, not the door to the classroom. please make it. and let it be controlled by wi-fi
when you press the button "more..." you can see live camera and can see what is happening all around the world
if you want to go back. press the button with a left arrow sign
