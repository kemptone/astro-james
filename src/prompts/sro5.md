sro5 doesn't reverse videos anymore. it becomes a bank where you can buy money for anything. and this game is for every kid that is named startig with an "M" so, name your child anything starting with M. also, you have to write your name. if your name starts with these letters: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z. then the game is disabled. so, please name yourself an M name to play with it. if you type "M" only. it would work. also, from gabe the slacker, there is penelope with a blue dress. she tells the player how it works. chris is her brother, he is mean. and molly is the baby. so, penelope tells you how it works. now, caillou in business friendly tells you the warning
