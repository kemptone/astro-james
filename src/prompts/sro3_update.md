sro3 will do something else. so, like i said, it will also have a tide feet
so here is how the tide works
6:00AM = high tide
12:00pm = low tide
6:00pm = high high tide
midnight = low low tide
if you type a time like 12:00pm. it will say low tide in less then a minute
it will do that to the rest
if you type 12
12:01pm. it will say high high tide in 5h 59m
so, it will tell you what tide it will be on the next tide point as long as it is after you enter a tide feet
but it will change
here
8.4ft-the tide you set = 8.4-what will equal what the tide feet will be generated. so, for example. type, 5.35ft. it will change to 3.05ft. so, try it out
