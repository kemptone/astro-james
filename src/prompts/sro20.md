for sro20, you need to set the temprature

so, the temprature is tricky. there is a temprature scale. when you arrive at this app, there is no temprature of the app. so, everything is disabled on the app until you set the temprature. so, try typing 23˚F, guess what? it is 97. because this is subtracting your input from 120
120 minus the number you equal = the answer in helvectica which is the size 100pt. make sure the style is that! 100pt
there is a submit button which will tell you the answer. and the emoji "cloud" will reset the tempratue and remove it. it will disable everything again
the submit button will enable everything again

so, there are 2 options
option 1 will:
• start having 5 empty inputs for each number
• 1 space like " " will have the lock emoji without a key. just a lock and the button is disabled
• the 5 inputs will trigger the 5 buttons. the number is how many times you can press the button. on the bottom of each button, there is a number of how many times you can press each button
• to make the button say free, type "00" for the input to make it free. it can be pressed 1 time but without the number 1
option 2 will:
• start having 5 empty inputs for each number
• each input has a number of which number will make it enabled infiniteley
• there is the emoji "lock" for under the number it unlocks. so, for example:
try typing 6 on button 1. it would become a green button when the input number is 6 and above
and... those are the options!
and there is also another input number which can tell you how many buttons there are. so, it is 5 already. change it to a different number and there will be less then or more then 5 buttons and inputs
there is also a blue button called "add bitbibbies"
that makes the games better to use. so, make sure to leave it on
now, type in numbers that are used for switches on the on position and off position
1 = just switch 1 and 2 are on
2 = all 3 on!
3 = 1 and 3 on
4 = 1 on itself
5 = just 2 on
6 = 2 and 3 on
7 = 3 on
and 8 = all 3 off
controll the switches!
