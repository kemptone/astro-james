sro9 has some problems. and in this game, they play pranks and tricks. and in this one, there is a serious warning with this rgb of the backround: 255 0 0
it is serious. so, this game MUST have bitbibbies. if the bitbibbies are off. then, tom's voice is an amazon voice: eric. it is he voice that is boris. you can talk to him, all day. if the bitbibbies are off, tom doesn't know what anything is. he wouldn't know what it is. so. without bitbibbies, he doesn't have a brain at all. no signal roads. good tom may have disabilities, or maybe pee by itself. so, keep the bitbibbies on. good tom and bad tom would both be neutral behavior. so, i will tell you how good tom responds:
i want to be a good person, in the future of how sro games can be best or fun. keep my bitbibbies on
now, bad tom has very bad language, so, only use this one if you are 18 or older and if you keep the bitbibbies off
here is how he responds:
what is it you goof. who is so like a stupid little crazy nut in sand, just put sand in your hair and roll down you stupid brat
here is his voice for bad tom. eric from amazon. good bye, we will work on this tomorrow. have a great day!
