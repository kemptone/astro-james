sro9 is nearly the last app we'd choose. so, 10 sro's in astro. so, sro5 will become a bank tomorrow where you can buy any money. so, just type sro5, then you see that bank. so, that is what sro5 does, but we dove into this prompt of sro9 and is very clever to make. so, in sro9, here's what will happen
so, the time you choose will turn into the oppisite. so, the coustom time will be military time which means, 24:00 would be 12:00AM. and 12:00 would be 12:00PM which means 12 hours in the past, and 12 hours more. and now, we are going to do this: so, 23:00 would not be 11:00pm, it would be 1:00AM. this game is trying to trick you
so, you can watch pretend TV and this game is for ages newborn-infinite age. this game is totally free. with no WI-FI needed, no ads, and it is this many times you can do it: ∞. ∞ is an infinite time. play now!!!
the prompt will say that you will type 23:00. then, the time will turn out to be 1:00AM
so, they trick you in this one, so, if the player says and presses 11:59, it will be 12:01PM
so, in this one, here's what'll happen
so, in sro9, you can choose a time, and you select it using military time. and then, when you click "submit" the time would be generated into a 12 hour clock and have AM and PM with it
