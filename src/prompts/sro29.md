SRO29 is the game where we start to loose things. so, there is 3 inputs for each city, the name, the so, there is the list of cities in each color so Aysia can play with you. right now, we will set the temprature and air quality. so, we set it in this way. lowest temperature to highest
for temperature:
0 = black
1 = blue
2 = sky blue
3 = aqua
4 = medium temperature which means no temperature (128 128 128)
5 = yellow
6 = orange
7 = red
8 = dark red
and you can do decimals between these numbers
and you can type the input for the temperature of this city
next, air quality, and there is a scale which is on a bar which goes from 1-500. and this counts for the air quality index (US) and this is the air quality for the computer. and it was 34 when this game started. the air quality is 56 now
and there is tracking temperature over days, telling us what it is. the input numbers that go to 100 will be in the game. what % right? 0 means it is to the far left, and 100 means it is to the far right. and there is a video but when it plays, nothing happens. the input for your number which is how many seconds will represent how long the movie is. if it is set to 7200, the video will be 2 hours
