in this game, oh! you won't believe it, well, there is this document thing around and tells about it in it's details. i know. you know what is wierd? no body tag. so all this stuff is out of the body tag. wooh! how cool! now in this game you need to memorize what switch does which? well, tere is a very BIG textarea. the width is all the way across the app! and the height is 100vh! well that is where there is no placeholder. it is just notes to just correct your spelling, hey, it remembers what the last sro15 was. it was about ivy with 5 teams who are zander, carmen, stephanie, xavior, and dexter the dog. so everyone usually gets the top row which is high-fives. that means this app will have a little mixed. but here is the array:
so, there is 1 row with 5 columns
the 1 row is high-fives, which is allowed when somebody does a good job. but still, that is very special
the columns are zander, carmen, stephanie, xavior, and dexter the dog. and they are pretty big checkmarks. the size is 100pt! and also there is no spaces which means it is not taken apart at all!
now here is what it does
so, inside a backyard. are 4 numbers. since that the numbers are too few, it is with an option
but wait! there is a slider to adjust the temprature of the app. so, here is the scale. it only reaches -140 to 120
-140 to -100 = super cold
-99 to -41 = cool stroke cold
-40 to 31 = freezing
32 to 50 = very chilly
51 to 65 = chilly
66 to 80 = warm
81 to 92 = hot
93 to 105 = very hot
106 to 119 = oven hot
120+ = burning hot
now, we have done that for now
so let's talk about it
so there is a white switch, a black switch, an up switch, and a down switch
here are the numbers:
1 means it is controlled by white, and up
2 means it is controlled by white, and down
3 means it is controlled by black, and up
4 means it is controlled by black, and down
so here is what it does for
you also can type it in an input, and there is a submit button which will put 4 summary details with all the helvectica style things that each switch does. so, let's play this game, soon!!!!!
