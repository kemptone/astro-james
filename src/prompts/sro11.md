hey there, we decided to go past sro10. in this game, you can talk to 2 people about the game we play
if you want to turn on bitbibbies you can. the bitbibbies are just a switch, it doesn't trigger anything. just, good alexa and bad alexa need bitbibbies so that good alexa and bad alexa can be happy. if the bitbibbies are off, then good alexa and bad alexa can talk, however, whenever they want bitbibbies, please turn it on
this game also has 100 alarm emojies and says: SUPER DUPER SERIOUS WARNING!
you cannot play with bad alexa ever. because bad alexa is for nobody. if you have a parent or guardian, the parent ca't let you. if the parent does, the parent could go to federal prison
