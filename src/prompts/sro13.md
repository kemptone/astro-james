sro13 is one of the most good apps. now, i add tags to this prompt
in this app you can create a schedule in fantasy
so, the app tricks you
so, in the schedules, i doesn't have AM or PM. that is a trick. and there is a dog who goes, woof woof, and he is the dog person. there is good dog and bad dog
good dog responds: woof woof, i am a good dog, i want to make everyone feel happy
bad dog responds: woof woof! go touch grass! you filthy old person!
so, there are 4 input radios
1 is with just good dog
2 is both, good dog and bad dog
3 is just bad dog. so maybe you cannot do 3 much
4 is if you don't want to talk to any of them. (no dogs)
now, the radio stuff is over. we are ready ti dive into this extreme fun game
now, this is the person who is allways here. it is grok who speaks in an eric voice from amazon, like in talkers1 even though it isn't there
ask grok anything. you can tell him anything
now, we just will talk about the schedule
and there is a kid mode that is a switch. tap it and input radio 2 and 3 will be disabled. because 2 shows bad dog and 3 as well
in this app, we have schedules. now the time does not have AM or PM
this is it here
1:00 = 11:00
2:00 = 10:00
3:00 = 9:00
4:00 = 8:00
5:00 = 7:00
6:00 = the same
7:00 = 5:00
8:00 = 4:00
9:00 = 3:00
10:00 = 2:00
11:00 = 1:00
12:00 = the same
