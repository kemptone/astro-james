this game drives everyone nuts. so, this is a game where you talk to square brackets. this is a text to speech. so, 2 square brackets are both. so, square bracket 1 which goes this way: { will speak in the lowest voice which is joey from talkers1 in astro. and bracket 2 which faces } will talk in ana voice from microsoft in talkers2. so, this is fun here. you press the key number on the computer to change the lights. so
if you press 1, light switch 1 is on and 2 and 3 are off
if you press 2, light 1 and 2 will be on but 3 is off
if you press 3, all light switches will be on
if you press 4, 1 is off and 2 and 3 are on
if you press 5, just 3 is on and 1 ad 2 are off
if you press 6, all 3 lights are off
if you press 7, 2 is on and 1 and 3 are off
if you press 8, 1 and 3 are on and 2 is off
there is also an input number that changes the value of the slider which goes 100 steps so in the input that is a number, minimum is 0 and maximum is 10. also, there is a thermomiter game too where you can set the temprature of the game. so, 120 minus the number you type = the answer on the board which the font family is helvectica and the size is 100pt. and this is the funnest part here: a big textarea without a placeholder and the size is here:
width = 100%
height = 100vh
there is also a video to watch. it is about a puffer fish
