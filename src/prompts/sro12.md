sro12 is pretty much it. in sro12, this is what the fun does
so, in this one, there are switches that are plain
1 would mean that switch 1 is on and 2 and 3 are off
2 means 1 and 2 are on
3 means 1 2 and 3 are on which means all on and flipped up
4 means just 1 is off and 2 and 3 are on
5 means just 3 is on. the rest are off
6 means that none are on. they are all off
7 means just 2 is on and 1 and 3 are off
8 means 1 and 3 are on but 2 is off. 8 is the oppisite of 7 in this case
