hello!!!!! this is an exciting game for others. but we have 22 sro's, and we will be diving in a lot here. but there are 2 buttons. button 1 will reset the week schedule. button 2 will reset the colors in a bar
so, we have this aid named freddie. he will tell you things
so, freddie typed in with the input: 1 3 5. and typed in what it is. so he would of done train rides. freddie would of done it monday, wednesday, and friday. let's see

1 is monday
2 is tuesday
3 is wednesday
4 is thursday, which is the correct term
5 is friday
6 is saturday, which is disabled if you don't do the colors
7 is sunday
8 is snuggleday, which is what somebody made up. you can name that guy whatever you want
so, try 2 4, and will happen tuesday and thursday
now this makes people think of storage on an iPad

okay, so freddie will match what happens. he will set a color and types 11. he wants to color to be red. it would make it go to 11% in the bar
Neat:
if you add another color and goes to red, and type in 20. it would show a line at 11 and it will end at 20% in the bar

ohhh! and this is where the switches are and try controlling them because they are fake
2 inputs:

the input on the left will control 1 and 2
if it was 1 then 1 would be on and 2 off
if it was 2 then 1 would be on and 2 on
if it was 3, it is the opposite of what 1 does. 1 off
if it was 4, 1 and 2 are off
now the input on the right controls 3 and 4
if 1, 3 is on and 4 off
if 2, 3 and 4 are on
if 3, 3 is off with 4 turned on
if 4, both are off. try them and control them for mr. grok. you can talk to him
