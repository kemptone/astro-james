DAT stands for: Date And Tide
so, this is called dat. dat, can control anything. but it on only goes 12 hours
this game works, but it is only 10-10. this game is for 10 year olds, and also. let's dive into how it works:
so, if you want it to be nighttime, use a time from 5:00pm-4:59AM
if you want no moon at all and it is nighttime, select, 5:00pm. you can see the entire moon at 6:00pm, and at 12:00am, the moon is fully up. at 5:00am, that is when the moon is fully down again like 5:00pm, but no, not the same. you can see the sky getting lighter
6:00am is the first brightness on a tree or anything. if you see a light on something, that is 6:00am. you take a video and pause it. at 12:00pm, everything that is possible to have sunlight is all there. at 4:00pm, that is the very last light of the time. and it gets darker and darker and back to 5:00pm, it is the same as what the instructions say on line 5
it will do all this, and you can record a video in full camera. when the video is finished, you can save it to photos and watch it all over again. you can also pause the video if you want to forget something
and it also can show the time of this whole journey, and show you what time it is
